package fio is for interacting with the FIO Protocol (https://fioprotocol.io). FIO is the foundation for inter-wallet
operability, an EOS-based blockchain to enhance UX by simplifying naming conventions across multiple chains. This library
is primarily a wrapper for interacting with the FIO blockchain using the eos-go library from EOS Canada, which has been
imported as fio-go/eos.
