package "fio" is for interacting with the FIO Protocol (https://fio.foundation). FIO is the foundation for inter-wallet
operability. An EOS-based blockchain to enhance UX by simplifying naming conventions across multiple chains. This library
heavily relies upon the fantastic eos-go library from EOS Canada. Much gratitude for such a capable underpinning to this
project.

This library primarily extends the eos-go library to provide access to FIO-specific functionality. See the godoc examples
for in-depth coverage.
